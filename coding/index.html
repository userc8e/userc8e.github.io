    <p> Through years of school classes and summer camps, I have gained proficiency in using the languages Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Swift, Kotlin, and GDScript. <br>
        I aim to continue honing my skills in programming and UI/UX design, both in my free time and as an intended Computer Science & Interaction Design major at GW! <br>
        Along with this website, here are some of my favorite projects so far! </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li> For our first college hackathon, my partner and I designed a website that simultaneously promotes small businesses and mitigates feelings of homesickness and loneliness in college students! </li>
                        <li> The website uses Flask for Python in the backend, Natural Language Processing (Spacy Python Library), an Industrial Strength Natural Language Processor to use AI, and AWS t2 Medium EC2 Instance for hosting online. </li>

                        <li> For my senior year final project, I was tasked with creating a project using GDScript. </li>
                        <li> Along with my partner, we created a game about cooking and story telling, loosely based off of Shakespeare's play Hamlet. </li>
                        <li> As our first time using GDScript, we experimented with and implemented many features, including inventories, character animations, timed object interactions, etc. </li>

                        <li> We placed a special emphasis on diversity, as we recognize that the field of computer science is especially intimidating for minorities; we want our site to be welcoming to all who are passionate about computer science. </li>
                        <li> Our project aims to encourage people to take charge of their own future and create their own reality, regardless of the gender and diversity gaps found in the field. </li>
